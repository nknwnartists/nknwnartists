- 👋 Hi, I’m @nknwnartists, I'm inventer, artist and developer, I learn and research about everything to find connection of bits of knowledge allowing for greater potential  
- 👀 I’m interested in web3 and more sprecifically building node based developement as I see this as the functionality of the future. I'm looking to build and patent 
- my inventions, which focus primarily reducing need for on fossil fuel, thermal variant temperature power generation(create power from small temperature
- difference between above ground level and below ground level, as well as technology that harness ionic energy in the air. In other words build a more sustainable
- future and what better place to find the resources to do so but on what I think the way the future to be.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning developement in multiple areas at once, essential a team of one doing any task neccessary to move forward in what way I choose.
- I'm focusing alot on blender procedural materials and designing but I take breaks from that to learn about animation, node-red procedural node programming, 
- multi-signature wallets, smart contract writing, eth-scaffolding, DEX building, game developement, live nft building, and of course so much more. This is list is 
- endless if I were to keep going as I like learning all aspects while developing specific aspects. This does mean I end up researching things again when building 
- specific parts but when I do it's more familiar.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that really interest me but I'm mostly focusing on learn and experimenting with different things but I could be tempted
- with the right project or offer. I don't have much experience but I learn extremely quickly because I constantly research just about anything you could imagine.
- I also have endless ideas every day about characters, games, shows, enviroments, dapps and an endless list of projects, products and starting points.
